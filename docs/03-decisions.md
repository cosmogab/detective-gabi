# Decisions

One entry per decision, written when it was made. Context, options, choice, consequence.

---

## D1 — Multi-source with provenance, not a single vendor
**Context.** Every free source has holes; they disagree on employee counts and founding dates.
**Options.** One vendor and accept its gaps · several sources merged silently · several sources
with visible provenance.
**Choice.** Several sources, merged by priority (registry > API > website > web > LLM), with the
source, the date the fact was true and a confidence level attached to every displayed value.
**Consequence.** More code and a busier UI, in exchange for an app that degrades instead of
lying, and conflicts that become information rather than bugs.

## D2 — `No evidence found` instead of an estimate
**Context.** Small companies are absent from most sources. A language model will happily fill in
a plausible employee count.
**Choice.** A field with no source is null and renders as `No evidence found`, listing the
sources that were checked.
**Consequence.** Some reports look emptier. That emptiness is accurate, and it is enforced by a
test rather than by discipline.

## D3 — A pattern-derived email is never shown as verified
**Context.** Email patterns are easy to infer and impossible to verify for free.
**Choice.** Verified addresses carry a solid badge; inferred ones are labelled
`unverified pattern`; when there is nothing, nothing is shown.
**Consequence.** Fewer addresses displayed. A unit test guards it, so the promise is mechanical
rather than declarative.

## D4 — Next.js full stack rather than a separate API
**Context.** One day, one deliverable, keys that must not reach the browser.
**Options.** Next.js route handlers · Express API plus a Vite front end · NestJS plus React.
**Choice.** Next.js App Router. Route handlers keep every key server-side, one repo, one dev
command, deploys in minutes.
**Consequence.** Less visible separation of concerns than a dedicated backend, bought back by
the frozen provider interface in `lib/providers`.

## D5 — No database
**Context.** Nothing in the brief needs to persist between visits.
**Choice.** A TTL cache plus committed fixtures. On Vercel the filesystem is ephemeral, so the
cache is a quota guard and a warm-instance speed win, not storage.
**Consequence.** No history, no comparison between companies. The demo works regardless of
quota because the fixtures are in the repo.

## D6 — Not a chatbot
**Context.** The reflex for anything involving a model is a chat interface.
**Choice.** One input field, one structured document.
**Consequence.** No follow-up questions. The output is scannable, linkable and comparable, which
matters more here than conversation.

## D7 — Bring your own key, on top of a keyless baseline
**Context.** The deployment is public and the default keys are mine; free quotas are small.
**Choice.** Three levels — no key at all (Wikidata, GLEIF, EDGAR, site scraping), default keys
behind a per-IP rate limit, or the user's own keys entered in a modal and held in
`sessionStorage` only.
**Consequence.** The app never fails for want of a key; it says less. Keys are never persisted
server-side and never logged.

## D8 — The loading screen is the real log
**Context.** A progress bar has to be honest in an app whose whole argument is honest data.
**Choice.** Every line of the loading state is a real server event, streamed as it completes. No
timers, no scripted pacing. The log is kept and folded under the report; failures stay visible.
**Consequence.** Fast steps flash past. That is what actually happened.

## D9 — Failure states are injectable, and labelled
**Context.** Quota exhaustion and dead sources need to be demonstrated without waiting for them.
**Choice.** The fake providers written for the unit tests are reused behind `?demo=`, and any
simulated state is labelled `simulated` on screen.
**Consequence.** One mechanism serving tests, demos and the walkthrough — and no staged failure
passed off as a real one.
